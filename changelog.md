- Now compatible with SpongeForge (requires Farseek 2.3.0 or newer).
- Fixed a [crash with Cubic Chunks](https://github.com/delvr/Repose/issues/20) (requires Farseek 2.3.0 or newer).
- Blocks falling instantly (due to server lag or unloaded chunks) now behave in a manner more consistent with blocks falling as normally as entities; for example they will now [break upon landing on half-slabs](https://github.com/delvr/Repose/issues/19).
- Internally, started migrating away from deprecated Farseek 2.x world-access wrappers.
