- Added [a config option to prevent blocks from falling when resting on solid "partial" blocks such as slabs, or breaking when landing upon them](https://github.com/delvr/Repose/issues/19).
- Fixed falling blocks breaking certain blocks such as ladders when falling instantly, but not when falling normally.
- Fixed [certain small animals still suffocating in sloping blocks](https://github.com/delvr/Repose/issues/41.).
- Fixed [unwanted leaves falling/spreading behavior with Chop Down Updated](https://github.com/delvr/Repose/issues/42).
